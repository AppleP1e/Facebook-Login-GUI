# MultiloginApp
A simple GUI written using Tkinter for automated loging to Facebook and Atlas email. It is a learning project and the code is really ugly and messy. I plan on working on it in the future and make it into usable, extensible app that can be easilz modified and can be used as automated login to some web based services. 
But as of right now, it is ugly and messy (but it is well documentated mess!). 
I discourage any real programmers from looking into the code because your eyes will bleed and the rivers of insanity will sink into your brain as I dont really understand using cycles across multiple Tkinter windows and I dont use global variables nearly as often as I should.
Thank you for your understanding with me, a humble beginner. 

Best regards
