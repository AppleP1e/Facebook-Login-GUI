# Facebook login GUI
A simple GUI written using Tkinter for automated loging to Facebook. It is a learning project and the code is really ugly and messy. I plan on working on it in the future and make it into usable, extensible app that can be easily modified and can be used as automated login to some web based services. 
But as of right now, it is ugly and messy (but it is well documentated mess!). 

Thank you for your understanding with me, a humble beginner. 

Best regards
